State Quality Function - 

This state quality function has changed over time, 
but generally aims to represent the Relative 'Rating' of a given society.

In the real world, this could pertain to a sum or weight of ratings across different domains such as
infrastructure, water quality, air quality, socio-economic values, intra-country resource distribution, etc.
