'''
Search Node.

TreeNode-Like Structure, implementing an A* Search:

        A* :=  g + h,
        g := state quality function
        h := state heuristic function

        h necessarily never over-estimates (such that it is admissible).
        as Such, h derives its value by assuming a "minimal utilization"
        of a given resources 'potential'
