# define Node class so that can be referenced for redefining as Composite/Recursive manner


class Node():
    pass


'''
Search Node data structure.

Can be implemented in Main class as either a Uniform Cost/Best First Search, 
or a Greedy/Local Depth First (default)

Uses a composite like pattern, and tracks the "world state".
Each node is a representation of the world state after N events have occured (given depth of search) 

children: the successors of the cur rent world state
schedule: list of events/actions which led to this state
schedule_probablity: likelihood an event
